SDLc ("SDL classes") is a basic set of C++ classes that wrap the C interface of
SDL. It does not attempt to be a complete framework, merely to make SDL a
little bit easier to use in an OOP setting.

The initial version was written in traditional C++ (C with classes style) in
2000-2002. If I get around to it, I'll eventually refactor the code to a more
modern template based style, as well as using the new features in C++11.

SDLc initially grew out of the Kexx2 game.

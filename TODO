Things to do:
-------------

General:
- Consolidate SDL_ calls to interfaces (for mocking/testing).

Nice to have:
- Give Sound and Music common base class.

Open questions:
---------------

Surface rework
- Implement internal_* load functions that does not call reset()
- Constructors for Surface::alloc/load should not delegate to default constructor.
- Make Surface new/delete exception safe (maybe it already is?).

BaseSurface
- Line functions are far to verbose.

Mixer
- Decide how global functions such as volume and fadeout best is treated.

Timer
- Limit the amount that the frame time can increase / decrease per step.

Font
- Return smart pointer or reference from get_char?
- Change the data structure in Font.cpp to use unicode compatible modern
  chars/strings.

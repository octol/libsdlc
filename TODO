Plugins:
- Cscope
- YouCompleteMe

Things to do:
-------------

General:
- Throw exceptions if loading fails.
- Change the enums to the new c++11 variant (Define.h and Input.h).
- Change the data structure in Font.cpp to use unicode compatible modern
  chars/strings.
- Consolidate SDL_ calls to interfaces (for mocking/testing).

Nice to have:
- Give Sound and Music common base class.
- Make Surface new/delete exception safe
- Can we get rid of Misc.h? (Rename?)

Sprite
- Constructors for copying other than Surface data.

Open questions:
---------------

BaseSurface
- Line functions are far to verbose.

Mixer
- Decide how global functions such as volume and fadeout best is treated.

Timer
- Limit the amount that the frame time can increase / decrease per step.

Font
- Return smart pointer or reference from get_char?

BaseSurface
- print_surface_info() Should probably return ostream instead of printing directly
- Print functions could be cleaned up.
- Line functions are far to verbose.

Surface
- Remove all references to SDL_GetVideoSurface();

Sprite
- Change to "composition" instead of "inheritance"

Mixer
- Decide how global functions such as volume and fadeout best is treated.
- Currently uses extern Mixer

Timer
- Limit the amount that the frame time can increase / decrease per step.
- Make sure all code uses Timer:ticks() instead of SDL_GetTicks()

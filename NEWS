    Version 0.5.1 is a minor update, mainly cleaning up.

    SDLc 0.5.0 includes a rewrite of the reference counting more in line
    with how Koening does it. Decided to remove the debug logging introduced
    earlier, mainly for code clarity, but also since I don't think it is
    particularly useful. The ugly line functions in BaseSurface have been
    cleaned up a bit. Although it is not used anywhere yet, I decided to
    create an abstract base class for the Sound and Music classes which
    might be useful in the future.

    0.4.2 is a minor release with just a few tweaks. Instead of printing error
    messages to stderr, exceptions are now being thrown. The old enums
    have been replaced with the new (in C++11) enum class type.

    Surface, Music and Sound classes now have reference counted underlying
    data. Hence a new make_independent_copy() function has been introduced for
    the cases where you explicitly don't want to share data.
    I've also moved over to using gcc-4.8, so the development compiler flags
    have been slightly altered in configure.ac.

    The initialization functions have been changed to map more closely to the
    underlying SDL calls. This should make the process more transparent.

    The migration is now complete. Should be able to focus on structural
    issues from now on.

    Started the migration to the new naming convention.

* Tue, 05 Mar 2013 17:42:28 +0000: Jon Haggblad <jon@haeggblad.com>

    Version 0.2.0 now has a reasonable public interface due to the new sdlc
    namespace and the global header file.

    While SDLc was initially written 10 years ago as part of the Kexx2 game,
    this (libsdlc-0.1.0) is the first release separate from Kexx2. The changes
    are very minor.
